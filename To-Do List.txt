Notes: 
Put up doc on Induction from Velleman (as he has nice proofs regarding WOP and Closure)
as well as those papers regarding strong and weak induction.
Put up doc on transfinite numbers (cardinals) and of course (ordinals)
Learn CSS and HTML and JS to build website
may want to study more logic, set theory, and computer science (info theory, computability, and ofc logic in philosophy)

In general go from Set Theory to Category Theory (AFTER SEEING ENOUGH NORMAL MATH) to HoTT and Topos Theory (read Conceptual Math before tho). 
Logic (formal/matematical things like the lambda calculus etc) should be studied with Computer Science
